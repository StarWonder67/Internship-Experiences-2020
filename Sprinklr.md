### Question 1
Find the number of beautiful substrings in a string. Beautiful string is described as one which has no repeated characters.

No constraints given

### Question 2
3 aliens invade earth. There are N cities on the planet, each located at some x coordinate. An alien with energy E and located at coordinate Y can destroy all cities within the range [Y-E,Y+E], (both end points inclusive) . Find the minimum energy E required to destroy all the cities. Note that, the energy 'E' of all the aliens should be same and return 'E' correct to 1 decimal place.

No constraints given


### Question 3
Given a graph of N nodes with M bidirectional edges. Each edge has some weight associated with it. You have K wildcards. When you use a wildcard on an edge, you can pass that edge without adding its weight.Assuming Vertex 1 is source vertex,in the path from vertex 1 to any other vertex i (2 <= i <= n), you can use atmost K wildcards while traversing. Note: You can use atmost K wildcard from vertex 1 to vertex 2. Now, you can again use atmost K wildcards from vertex 1 to vertex 3 and so on to vertex n. i.e. you can use atmost K wildcards in each path from source to destination. You have to find minimum distances from vertex 1 (source) to all other nodes in graph.

Constraints: 1 <= n,m <= 500000, 1 <= K <= 15
